# python-netsurv
Python library for configuring a wide range of IP cameras which use the NETsurveillance ActiveX plugin

## DVR-IP, NetSurveillance  or "Sofia" Protocol
The NETSurveillance ActiveX plugin uses a TCP based protocol refered to simply as the "Digital Video Recorder Interface Protocol" by the "Hangzhou male Mai Information Co".

There is very little software support or documentation other than through tools provided by the manufacturers of these cameras, which leaves many configuration options inaccessible.
